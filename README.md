# Relearning to Code
Repository for dumping snippets or trials in my journey to re-learn how to code.

It's almost Q4 of 2024; I've been in working the industry for 12 years now. For the last 5 years, I've barely been coding and I'm guilty of resting on my laurels - assuming I did have laurels in the first place. I'm confident that I can still throw down with high-level discussions on tech and can still guide my team through the principles I've learned. However, I'm also certain that my skills in actually writing code has severely languished. I can read them, yes; give me any code and I can follow what's written there in a few hours. But, I know that if I was suddenly asked to actually write code, I'll be the least productive member of the team. 

Palms sweating, knees weak, arms heavy, code spaghetti.

Let's see if we can keep it up this time...
